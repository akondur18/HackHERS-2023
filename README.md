# HackHERS-2023
You’re at the gym, returning from a mean game of racquetball when you realize your gym bag isn’t where you left it. You realize it’s been stolen along with your gym clothes and wallet. Panicked, you think of the only thing you can do before any large purchases are made: call your bank/credit card company to freeze your cards. 
What if there was a system in place so transactions couldn’t go through without your approval?
We’ve created FinSafe, an app that protects users from fraudulent charges to you credit cards. When a transaction exceeds the user's specified limit, FinSafe will prompt a (push) notification to verify whether or not the user wants to allow the transaction. 
This enables a two-step authentication factor for transactions over a specific amount, ensuring the security of your credit card, and giving you some peace of mind.
